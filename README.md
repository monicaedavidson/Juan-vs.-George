Juan-vs.-George
===============
This code was written by Monica Davidson and is for the assignment titled, "Race against the rabbit." 

This simulation was created to show a race between two animals: a rabbit and a turtle. The animals have 4 properties to them that help dictate who wins the race. The rabbit, named "Juan", is easily distracted and this makes him lose the race no matter what. The turtle, however, is not easily distracted and wins the race no matter what. The property "focus" is used to set this. Even though the rabbit is faster, the turtle wins because his "realSpeed" is larger. "realSpeed" is calculated by multiplying speed and focus.

A loop is used to measure who wins the race. If the rabbit and the turtle both go over "100" at the same time, then an alert is issued that tells the user that it is a tie. If the rabbit goes over 100 before the turtle, then an alert is issued that tells the user that the rabbit has won and vice versa. Loop will break once one of these three conditions is satisfied.
